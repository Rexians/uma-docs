Roster is a new feature and cannot be controlled from only the API. So, A new method has been made for working with the roster.&#x20;

The Rexians website has a cool new feature which can be accessed from [**here**](https://mcoc.rexians.tk/login).&#x20;

The User has to login by clicking on the button:

Click on the Authorize Button which will therefore take you to the Gamename adder page! Write your gamename (Note: Make sure it is correct because you will never be able to change it again) and proceed further.

You will be atlast redirected to your Profile Page where you can add champs and see your existing added champs:
