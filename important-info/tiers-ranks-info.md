# Tiers/Ranks Info

### Limitations of Tiers

As we know, MCOC has 6 tiers, but not all champs are available in all the tiers. We get the data from [AuntM.ai](https://auntm.ai) who has the data for these champs even if they are not in the game. This lowest tier for a champion is 1 and highest is 6.\
Note - Tiers and stars (\*) are interchangable

### Limitations of Ranks

If you have been playing for MCOC for quite a while now, you would know not all ranks are there for each tier. For example, a 5\* has max rank 5 while 2\* have max rank 3.

Make sure the keep these resitrictions in mind when making the requests!

* 6\* shouldn't have a rank more than 4.
* 5\* shouldn't have a rank more than 5.
* 4\* shouldn't have a rank more than 4.
* 3\* shouldn't have a rank more than 4.
* 2\* shouldn't have a rank more than 3.
* 1\* shouldn't have a rank more than 2.
